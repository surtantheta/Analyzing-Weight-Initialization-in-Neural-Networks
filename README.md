# Analyzing-Weight-Initialization-in-Neural-Networks
Every Deep Learning book/tutorial points out the fact that weight initialization is an important design choice when developing deep learning neural network models. The initialization step can be critical to the model's ultimate performance, and it requires the right method. <br>
In this repo, we show the impact of various weight initializations on the accuracy of our model. We train our model on MNIST dataset. <br>
## Visualization
The model is evaluated using five-fold cross-validation. We plot the 5 accuracies for the 7 types of initialization as mentioned before.
